# Conclusion: 
Summing up, we solved the problem of mathematical and computer simulation of air 
flow around buildings. To build a mathematical model, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes 
equations were used, where there are no such parameters as diffusion coefficients 
because the height (of buildings) in this case is not as large as in the previous problems 
that were considered earlier in this course (i.e., the environment is relatively 
homogeneous). This model is used, since these equations completely describe the flow 
movement, and in this task, the space is two-dimensional, the problem is more local 
and accurate for calculation. Locality is proved by the fact that we have considered the 
case of two houses located not far from each other. To solve this problem, the method 
of splitting by physical parameters was used (the full numerical algorithm is described 
in paragraph 3). The grid dimension is 101*51 for more accurate results and detailed 
research. As stated in the analysis of the data obtained (paragraph 6), it turned out that 
in the case under consideration, the buildings are too close to each other and the 
overlap between them is low. This can lead to environmental damage and air pollution. 
And the presence of a road between them can significantly worsen the whole situation. 
Therefore, appropriate conclusions were made that the first building should be built 
either lower or at a sufficiently large distance for good ventilation between the houses
